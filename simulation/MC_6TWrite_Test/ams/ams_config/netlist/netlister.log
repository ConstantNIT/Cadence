INFO (VLOGNET-187): While generating an explicit netlist, it is recommended to
set the Terminal SyncUp option on the Netlist Setup form as 'Merge All' with
this option.
Alternatively, you can set the hnlVerilogTermSyncUp variable as
'mergeAll'. This helps in generating a pure explicit netlist.

INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/net/kafka/nfs/rstdenis/Cadence/simulation/MC_6TWrite_Test/ams/ams_config/netlist/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped table, set

simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the .simrc file

before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
WARNING (OSSHNL-360): Bus 'wack' uses both ascending and descending ranges.
The
bus will be declared with an 'ascending' range as specified by the skill
flag
'hnlSetBusDirectionDescending'.
For a bus consisting of ranges used in both the
directions, OSS uses the range
direction of the widest slice for the complete
bus. When the widest slices use
conflicting directions, OSS uses the range
direction defined by the skill flag
'hnlSetBusDirectionDescending'.

INFO (VLOGNET-118): Using connection by name (explicit connections) for all
stopping and 
non-stopping cells.
 
WARNING (VLOGNET-186): Unable to generate explicit netlist for the
'16nm/6T_SetRead/schematic' cell view because split buses and/or bundle
terminals are present in it.  
Set the Terminal SyncUp option on the Netlist
Setup form as 'Merge All' or set the hnlVerilogTermSyncUp variable as 'mergeAll'
and netlist again.

WARNING (VLOGNET-105): Cannot drop port ranges because the cell
'16nm/6T_SetRead/schematic' has split busses 
across module ports. Therefore,
ignoring the flag simVerilogDropPortRange.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-169): Module port ordering for lib '16nm_Tests', cell
'Write_Testbench_verilog', view 'verilog' will be
 done using the user specified
port order as follows:

 => ("A<16:0>" "RW<1:0>" "W1<3:0>" "W2<3:0>" "WdataAck<1:0>" "R1<3:0>" "R2<3:0>"
"RDataAck<1:0>" 
     "Ack" "VDD" "VSS")
